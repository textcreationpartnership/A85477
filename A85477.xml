            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Lord having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put it into my heart by his revealed will, to write to lost <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being truly sensible that she hath an immortal soul, in which I am deeply concerned, and for which I travel till it be born again in the particular and in the general: and therefore to thee as King, and as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, whom the Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb facs="tcp:150073:3"/> hath set upon <hi>Englands</hi> throne to that end, that thou mightst rule in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; therefore let not the King think it below him to read that which many think above me to write, in respect to my sex: but in that will which would li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the holy One in any sex or person, I write not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the thoughts of that minde judge of the matter, God being not there in them thoughts, neither is his righteousness wrought by that will; and therefore from that in any one do not I expect a good thought or word of that I shall write: but to the faithfull witness
<pb facs="tcp:150073:3"/> of the living God, which is sprung up out of the little seed, to <hi>bear witness</hi> whence it did <hi>proceed,</hi> to that I appeal, &amp; that I know in all wil not judge amiss of what I write. But this true experience hath taught me, that if any thing do think or speak evil of that it knows not, it will arise and judge it down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And O King <hi>Charles,</hi> thou maist do well to take heed to it as to a light shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a dark place, which sometimes is clouded over; and then the prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would judge of the matter: but let the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, and let the enemy of thy soul be confounded:
<pb facs="tcp:150073:4"/> and if thou canst not think or speak well of what is writ to thee in dear love to thy immortal soul, why for the Lords sake onely let it alone, till the light shall shine forth which makes manifest deeds of darkness, and judges all things as they are: which is able to try all things, and hold fast that which is good, which is given to all to profit withall, and to no other end, it being sufficient to teach all to deny ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and worldly lusts; which if obeyed, will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie eternally; and on the contrary, if disobeyed, or turned into wantonness, it
<pb facs="tcp:150073:4"/> will condemn for ever all those.</p>
            <p>But that the seed of the kingdom which was once spoken of to be the least of all seeds, and grew to be the greatest of all trees, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and grow, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, is the desire of my soul. Oh the heighth, the depth! the world is not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what might be writ concerning it; of which kingdome and dominion there is no end: but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faithful to a little, brings to be ruler over much. And that thou maist grow in it, I recommend it to thee, as the onely rule of a Christians life. For</p>

               <l>By an invisible and outstret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched hand,</l>
               <l>That thou in righteousnesse mightst rule and reign,</l>
               <l>To relieve the oppressed, and help ease the pain</l>
               <l>Of the sick and poor, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed,</l>
               <l>That thy call might be, Come thou blessed,</l>
               <l>Take thy reward which shall never cease,</l>
               <l>The crown of life, even everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting peace.</l>
               <l>This, this is Gods intent of bringing thee in hither,</l>
               <l>That thou the evil do prevent, and fear him altogether:</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:150073:5"/>
               <l> And seek him where he is to be found, &amp; call on him whilst neer,</l>

               <l>The guiltless he will hold so still, but those that his Name take</l>
               <l>In vain, he will not guiltless hold, even for his own Names sake.</l>

               <l>For his mercies do for ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure;</l>
               <l>And love his holy law doth ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill,</l>
               <l>For love doth love no blood to spill:</l>
               <l>Therefore in love do thou abide,</l>
               <l>That thou in love maist ever hide;</l>
               <l>For this is that will stand by thee,</l>

For this know, whoever thou art, that</hi> darkness hath

            <p>And the time of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is <hi>to day; if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the wilderness:</hi> for such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> but their carcases fell in the wilderness. Therefore Oh friends, that you might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive something by the types and figures, that so you might be brought to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150073:25"/> Christ, the end of all types and shadows, is the desire of my heart, and the end of my words. For surely, friends, if you do come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> you must pass tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the wilderness before you can come to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed land: and if you mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur here, you shall never enter, but come short, as they did in the figure. Therefore give heed to that which reproves for sin, that so in the way of God, which is good order, you may walk in, which is by stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding still, and seeing his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which is a hidden mystery to the blinde, as all godliness is; but he that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150073:25"/> can receive it, blessed shall he be for evermore: for all that cannot <hi>cease from doing evil,</hi> cannot <hi>learn to do well:</hi> Therefore to day if you will hear his voice, which may be terrible, yet let judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enter, and turn it not backward; for <hi>Sion</hi> must be redeemed by judgement; &amp; there is a flaming sword turns every way, to cut off all from coming to the tree, but that which cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish by the sword. And therefore dear hearts, kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks, countrey-men and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance after the flesh, prize your time; <hi>to day</hi> is your time, or the present time more properly, for you
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150073:26"/> cannot promise to your selves more then that: though one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day, yet your minute, or space, or hour, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend beyond its present time. Therefore this is the time of cleansing, when the Lord by his Spirit in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts reproves for sin in the conscience: this is the <hi>Ancient of days,</hi> which taught <hi>Enoch</hi> to walk with God, and is the true Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that cannot be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a corner, but seeth in secret and there reproves.</p>
            <p>Oh friends, that you could enter into the closet,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150073:26"/> where the jewels are made up, and shut the doors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, and do all you do as in singleness of heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, not for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause or praise of men; and then your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which seeth in secret will reward you openly: and there you may call him Father, being you worship in his Spirit, and keep in his fear: and this you will feel and know, when you are taught by the Spirit of God to pray as Christ taught his Disciples; when you can desire God to forgive you no further then you forgive others; and when you can pray for such as hate you,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150073:27"/> and despightfully use you, even your enemies: Truly friends, he is no true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian that cannot do so, be he of what name soever: for if any is come to think he hates another because he is Gods enemy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore persecutes him, and thinks him not worthy to live, it may be, or to enjoy his portion which is in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing things; and this spirit steals words, and saith the wicked shall fill up their measure; and it is but <hi>three days and a half</hi> and they shall be cut off; and so thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And at the times of ignorance God hath winked, and doth; but now he would have all men come to the knowledge of the truth.

Deceive not your selves any longer: that which is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in stead of a sweet smell, will not be accepted; your <hi>inventing to your selves instruments of Musick like David,</hi> will not serve the turn now; it is <hi>truth in the inward parts</hi> the Lord is a seeking for, and a clean heart and hands, free from violence and oppression, that his soul hath pleasure

            <p>Oh I desire for your sakes onely, that you would take what I write not with the excellency of mans wisdom well at my hand; if you
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150073:41"/> did, I might reason a little with you; if you are come to so high degrees, to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or old men in Christ, how came you thither? did you first in the first birth, growth and life, see your selves to be in the degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted estate, miserable, poor, blind and naked, onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above all that is called God? or are you yet in that state onely, thinking you are rich and full, and regenerated, and have need of nothing, yet want <hi>the one thing necessary?</hi> Oh my friends, I fear ye have not yet sold all and given to the poor, nor yet laid down your lives, nor yet took up
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150073:42"/> your cross and followed Christ, nor yet bowed at the Name of Jesus: the time is come that things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and things in earth, and under the earth, shall stoop to his Name: things shall not be so exalted any longer, nor those who are under their power, but they and the things must stoop at the Name of Jesus, before he works in them and for them. Oh I do desire for your sakes onely (for I fear not him that can kill the body, and no more) that you would not turn again and rent me. Hath the Word of life, which is nigh, in the heart and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150073:42"/> mouth, the sincere milk of the Word, which nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> up to eternal life, been food for your immortal souls? or hath an external thing or words been your rule and guide? Have you yet eat of the bread which comes from above, the immortal bread, which is as true nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment for the soul, as those things are for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which must perish with the using? or are you yet feeding upon chaff and husk, in which grain was once, but being gone out, the husk cannot nourish the soul, but on the contrary, pine and starve it? Oh my
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150073:43"/> friends, you must reverence him who is onely holy and reverend, before he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence you. Oh that you would stand bare before the hoary head, and give place to <hi>the Ancient of days</hi> to sit down, who hath long wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be gracious; whose locks are wet with the dew of the night; who is the <hi>Ancient of days,</hi> which was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and is at this day, and is to come: my desire is that you would exalt his Name for ever, and bring down and out all, that it may be laid low before him, whether it be Hebrew, Greek or Latine, which is lawfull in its place; but if
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150073:43"/> you set it over his head which is the true light that hath lighted every one that cometh into the world, you must be numbered with those that cried out, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him.</hi> Deceive not your selves, God will not long be mocked: for the nations shall fear before him: all nations who have drunk of the cup of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, must have that which followes, none can evade it; the Lords decree will stand: read in the <hi>Revelations</hi> of S. <hi>John,</hi> who writ that book in the Lords day; the Spirit spoke expresly as it meant, that <hi>all should partake of her plagues, who were drunk</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150073:44"/> but you must believe in Christ Jesus the light, or else your faith cannot be seen by your works, and so cannot be lively and true, without which it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to please God, who is a spirit, and will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped in spirit and in truth, and such he seeks to worship him: for burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and sacrifice he will not, but a body hath he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: for all that have an eye to discern, know the kingdom of heaven stands not in observations of Things, or Days, or Times, but in righteousness, joy, and peace in the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whose covering is above
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150073:45"/> and over all false covers, a safe hiding place, and a rock of defence; the righteous flee thither and are safe. Oh that you would be led by the Spirit of God, that so you might be children of God; for till then, if you say the Lord liveth, and swear it too, you do not speak truth to your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if he do not live in you: and his Spirit and the fruits thereof are plainly known. Oh that I could see you do good to all, and be filled with bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards all! then you would not go about to destroy him for whom Christ died, nor lay heavy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150073:45"/> burdens which you will not touch: for Gods way is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and he the same that ever he was; and if he is not revealed, it is to them that are lost: but great, and wise and prudent ones of the world, he is hid from, and is revealed to babes: and if out of the mouths of babes and sucklings the wisdom of the world shall be confounded, murmur not at it in your hearts: for the Lord will bring to pass his work, his strange work; his act, his strange act. And did my portion or well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stand in that which you can either give or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, I might fear you: but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150073:46"/> my treasure is not where moth or rust doth corrupt, or where thieves can break thorow and steal.</p>
            <p>Oh you Nobles of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who are as Noble as the earth can make you; your estate I know to be but low, and on perishing things you feed: the Lords table that should make you truly noble, you will not come unto: for I believe he hath knocked at the door of your hearts, and would have supped with you; but you would none of the Lords supper and his counsel, and therefore you cannot in that estate partake of his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150073:46"/> table. Oh consider your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state a little, all you who are set upon an unholy hill, your mountain must be overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there is no remedy; all must be overturned, that righteousness may reigne: your foundation is not good, for truly it must be rooted up in all that belong to God. Oh that you could believe, to the overturning of the strong holds of sin &amp; Satan, that Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable you might be: for as he was not a Jew who was one outwardly, and as the Circumcision which was then used was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of by the children of the light, but that of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150073:47"/> heart: so now it is not the name or outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Nobility will stand justified. He that search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart and trieth the reins is come down to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold whether your works are wrought in him; if not, he cannot behold them. Oh what a degenerating from truth is here, called <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> and <hi>Truly Noble,</hi> and yet known to be out of that which onely makes so! Oh that the peace of God you might all know! Why consider, what will it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit you if you could gain the whole world and lose your immortal souls? The Lords love is yet unto you, and he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150073:47"/> would have you repent, and seek him where he is to be found: for he that set your sins in order before you, is neer you; and if you can stand in judgement, he then will justifie you; if not, he will still condemn all those who are not found in him, who is the light that hath lighted every one that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the world, and is onely sufficient to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest deeds of darkness, and to reprove for them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hate not his reproof who is the true light: for those that do (according to what was formerly written by the Spirit of God) are brutish.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:150073:48"/>
            <p> And all ye Judges of <hi>England,</hi> with the light that is given you to that end that it may give light to every one of you, and be esteemed and set up by you, and not put out, or at least put under a measure of unbelief; with that light search, I say: do your ways please the Lord? if the Lord justifie, far is it from me to condemn: but search, I say; for your souls are of great price to the Lord: Are you <hi>Englands Judges as at the first,</hi> and her <hi>Counsellors as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</hi> or do you judge for reward? and if so, what is the reward?</p>
            <p>You may judge of this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:150073:48"/> matter: are your ways the Lords wayes? are your thoughts his thoughts? here are you called to true judgement: or are you yet in the broad way, where the most are? and are you yet thinking, that if you live in sin, you have a Redeemer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the clouds to save you in sin? and consider, are you in Gods way so far as to do to all men as you would be done unto? for that is but just and equal; and in words I know you will confess his ways are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual. But if you should say you love God whom you have not seen, and hate his creatures whom you have
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150073:49"/> seen, you do not say well: for how can it be? <hi>If you hate your brother whom you have seen, how can you love God whom you have never seen?</hi> And God is love, and in him is no hatred at all: for his eye is towards you now, while you are yet wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your bloud, and trampling the bloud of the covenant under your feet. Oh when I consider your condition, you who have the name of Judges, and who pretend to true judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, surely in the day of judgement great will your condemnation be: Oh that you would stand up for the Lord in your own conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces!
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150073:49"/> then should we finde favour and grace in your sight; but in the mean time we do not look for it: for we dearly know, that a bad tree cannot bring forth good fruit: and we have been contented to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongst transgressors, and have born the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of sinners; and one day you shall know the things concerning us have an end, and that it had been better for you not to have offended a little one, much more all the tender Lambs of the flock of Christ: when Christ shall come to some, and say, Come ye blessed of my Father; for when I was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150073:50"/> in prison, ye visited me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as you did visit my members; where will such appear in that day when the Lord makes up his jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, who on the contrary have cast them into prison, and strengthened the hands of evil doers by a law? if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? And if such should say, We did visit, &amp;c. and are Christians, but are not, (but of the synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan they are, and him there they have worshipped) that saying would be as vain as all the rest, onely to fill up the measure, and a <hi>depart</hi> shall come, a separation of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150073:50"/> light from darkness; and then weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth shall be the portion for ever of such.</p>
            <p>I know if the Lord should come to plead with all the learned men of the earth, and examine them: Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? all their wisdom from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low cannot tell, but they must lay their hands on their mouth, all flesh must be silent before the Lord, who will be terrible in his judgements, to that end that man may know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and God, and all as he ought to know. Oh ye wise
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150073:51"/> men of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> your life is but a span to the length of endless eternity; the grass of the field, which is green to day, and flourishing, and cut off to morrow, and cast into the oven, is an emblem of your lives: therefore spend not your time in vain; to morrow you may be cast into the oven, where the worm dies not: and which of you can dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting burnings? I know you will be to seek in this matter: for you have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God father indeed, but where is his fear, when the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness are brought forth in such abundance? yea, so
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150073:51"/> far from his fear in your selves, that you persecute o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers because they are kept in the feare of the Lord, who have known it to be a vain thing to say, We live, move, and have our being in God, when they did move and live in their own wills, which could not work the righteousness of God; and now they are come to that state to stand still, and see the Lord go before them in all their thoughts, words and actions: the world hates them, because they are redeemed out of it, or at least a working out their salvation with fear and trembling.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:150073:52"/>
            <p> And therefore, Oh ye Judges of <hi>England,</hi> in love to your immortal souls do I warn you to seek the Lord with all your hearts and all your mindes, and then he will be found: and do good to all, but especially to the houshold of faith: and let your moderation be known to all men: and cease to do evil, and learn to do well. And though some Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures may seem to shut out the most wise, and rich, and noble, from heaven (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is harder for such then for others, for the poor soonest receive the Gospel) and though it is as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a rich man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150073:52"/> as a camel to go thorow a needles eye; yet with God all things are possible: therefore if you come to him, you shall have the light of life. Oh that I could perswade you, not almost, but altogether to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians! for the time shall come, that all shall know the Lord, and then shall judges be as at the first, and counsellors as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and then shall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and truth run down the streets, and mercy and judgement shall kisse each other: for as your hour and power of darkness hath been known &amp; felt, and the shadow of death we have

And though there are Prophets, as there were of old, who do prophesie falsly, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and

            <p>And all ye Ladies of <hi>England,</hi> who walk with stretched-out necks, and wanton eyes, mincing as you go, and making a clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering with your feet, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling your hair, and painting and spotting your faces, wearing gorgeous array, and the like; why consider,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150073:55"/> when you come to give an account for all things done in the body, where will you appear? for none of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dornes the Gospel; God works none of these works in you or for you; and one day you shall know you have not lived and moved in him, for he is the author of none of this: you shall not have so much time for sinning as you have had heretofore: if you will not bow to the righteous law written in the heart, that which reproves in secret for these and all other sins, you shall fall &amp; perish in them; for in the grave there is no repentance. Let no blinde
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150073:55"/> guide or merchant of souls sell you any longer to work wickedness, by sowing pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and daubing with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered mortar: I in plainness tell you, <hi>He that commits sin is of his father the devil, and his works they do.</hi> And vials of wrath will be poured forth on the seed of evil doers, and then it will be hard for you to kick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the pricking of your conscience: you had better never been born, then to die in your sins; you were not created to that end: the Lord had rather you were alive because of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then dead in sin: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in time be warned;

            <p>Dear hearts, my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, kinsfolks and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance after the flesh, for whom I travel till you are born again of water and the Spirit, till which you can never see God, or know any thing as you ought to know; in precious love to your immortal souls (who was one with you in death,

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:150073:57"/> they did intend to make me one by that way and form of the Protestant Church so called.

And hereby let none conclude that I deny original sin, or sin in its original to be sin: but where sin hath no ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, I dare not say it hath; and before it had a being, I dare not say it had: for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:150073:58"/> the image of God is undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led where ever it be.</p>
            <p>But some will say, We brought sin into the world with us, from our parents, and that is original sin: for is it not written in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>In sin was I conceived and brought forth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That cannot properly be called original sin, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents conceiving and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the child in sin: if its parents have sinned, it may be they may die in them, and be their last sin, and therefore cannot be called original as to the parents. And the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents sin cannot be imputed to the children, being the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150073:58"/> soul that sins must die; then could not the kingdom of heaven be of such; and therefore as to the children it cannot be called original: neither when a child comes to die, and to be born of the feed of old <hi>Adam,</hi> it is not because the parents sinned, or not sinned, but because that the works of God might be manifested, and to that end all might come to live in the second <hi>Adam,</hi> as they have died in the first. Therefore let none think that they are regenerated &amp; born again by others vain babling, for they cannot do as they promise and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for them, for it is the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150073:59"/> Lord onely can change the heart, after it is fully bent to do wickedly; but they neither do it, or believe it, and therefore this <hi>most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ordinance of God,</hi> as they call it, is sin; for according as it was written formerly, <hi>Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</hi> For if I should ask any of the Right Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in God (as they are called) <hi>Do you believe that this child can forsake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and all his works?</hi> I know they cannot say we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, because they are sold under sin for term of life, being in the covenant of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, pleading for him and his kingdom, whose dead
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150073:59"/> faith gives them to believe the power of Satan greater then the power of God, and according to their faith the Scripture is fulfilled to their condemnation; the prince of darkness, the God of this world, lulling them on in carnal security, till the tree which was known by his fruit, falls, and so it must lie. And let no diviner for money lead you on till you fall in the ditch, but believe and be baptized in the Name of the Father, Son and holy Spirit; for it is not the outward washing will availe, but the new creature: for this I know of a truth to be as vain as all
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:150073:60"/> the rest of mans ordinances, and oblations &amp; worships, being I was used after this manner, according to the Church of <hi>England:</hi> yet notwithstanding they said I was regenerated, I was not in twenty eight years after, in which space death passed on me; and in my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood I eat of the forbidden fruit, and by it transgressed Gods law, and would none of his counsel, because I did not know him; but a desire I had to finde him out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong professors of Religion in my childhood: I sought him, but could not finde him amongst them, neither had I any food for my soul whilst
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150073:60"/> I was in their way. Then one with the Royalists so called was I accounted above ten years, where I beheld much wickedness, though not in so high places, or with such fair colours and large co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as the professors had; and by this sort was I not like to be snared or decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, because I saw plainly, that swearing, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and whoredom, and idle jesting, and vain sports and shews, I did believe all such, and many more to be naught, and so was kept from that sort of sinning in great measure; and would say often I had my Religion to chuse, and until I could
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150073:61"/> finde a better then yet I had found, I would be of none. So in this miserable state I lived some years, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of I knew not what continually, but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of death then of any other thing. Yet the Lord did all my life-time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict me, and many great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and crosses I had in the world, which since I have seen plainly was to draw me neerer to himself, and to make me know my self, that so I might deny my self, and exalt him alone, being much perplext and filled with troubles in the world; and having failed in all my expectations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150073:61"/> which it made me of contentment in perishing things, I began to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my life, and still afraid to die, my conscience accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing me that I had not done as I ought to do, though I was all my life in great measure kept from acting what I knew to be sin, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I know what I had omitted; so in this blinde state I durst not die. Then being miserable, and poor, and blinde and naked, and having no helper in the earth, the Lords time was then to direct me by the mouth of his Prophets to a light which was placed in darknesse, but darknesse
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150073:62"/> could not comprehend it: but before I ever had heard any of them, or saw any of them, I heard they were a people could lay down their lives one for another, that they were of one heart and one minde; which hearing, raised such a power in me which wrought by love, that I quickly found the report to be true; and then I was unsatisfied continually till I had heard some of them: and after I had heard, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had one word to speak, or durst think one thought of evil of any of them; for they had directed me to that in my own particular, which did shew me all that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:150073:62"/> ever I had done. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun I to be led by the Spirit of God out of darkness into his marvellous light: but whither his hand hath led me since, and where I have known him most, is too hard to be uttered, or by you to be born.</p>
            <p>Oh my friends, my friends, it is the living onely can praise the Lord, the dead cannot: <hi>A living dog is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a dead lion:</hi> for crums that fall from the masters table may come to them. Oh all you that are without, crums you may have, if you believe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to you: for then you may find more comfort in a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150073:63"/> crum of true bread which falls from heaven, then in all the husks you have been musking in.</p>
            <p>I have declared something of my condition to you, that you may know there is no peace to the wicked, saith my God. And all you that are travelling out of <hi>Sodom</hi> with your faces towards <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> look not back: <hi>remember Lots wife,</hi> who became a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of salt, a thing in its sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and measure the most savory, but out of its place and measure the most unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory, and good for nothing when it hath lost its savor, but to be trodden under foot of men. Remember, I
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:150073:63"/> say, look not back, but press forward to the mark of so high a calling; for the race that is set before us is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: therefore so run that you may obtain; not swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for fear of bloudshed and destruction; but let pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have its perfect work.</p>
            <p>Oh that you could read with understanding the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations!</hi> But if it and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writings writ by the holy Spirit of God be dark sayings to you, why do not longer blot your names out of the book of life, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or diminishing. O the time is come, and coming, that the souls of them which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:150073:64"/> were sold for a perishing thing, cry for vengeance: And where will <hi>Englands</hi> watchmen appeare, who must be numbred with <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> merchants, who among all the stuff they were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of and for, souls was one? Oh merchants, the ransomed of the Lord are out of your clutches; a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able consideration is paid: neither your treasure, nor the place of your treasure, can induce them back, who have begun in the Spirit, and in the same ended what is ended: neither your flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries or your frowns, your evil report or your good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, neither if you would
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:150073:64"/> promise, and were able to perform, that you would give such the whole world, and all the pomp and riches that it contains, to fall down and worship the god of this world, they could not do it: it is already cast behinde all those who fit in heavenly places with Christ Jesus, and have passed into the city thorow the gates, &amp; have tasted of the tree that bears twelve maner of fruits, and do know the Law (and Law-giver) and wherefore it was added: such cannot now go into death the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, believing if they should, they should never more finde place of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:150073:65"/> having once tasted of the good word of God, if they should crucifie him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain afresh; this were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to renew such: for it was appointed for <hi>all men</hi> but once to die, and after death to come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but those on whom the second death hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, God will never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for to renew them to repentance, and therefore it is altogether impossible. And therefore doe not blame those who had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enjoy the afflictions of <hi>Joseph,</hi> then the pleasures of sin for a season: and were not peoples hearts as hard as the <hi>nether mill-stone,</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:150073:65"/> they would ere now have considered the afflictions of <hi>Joseph</hi> or <hi>Lazarus:</hi> but this is the hour and the power of darkness of all who are in <hi>Cain, Esau, Pharaohs</hi> or <hi>Dives</hi> nature; such shall to their great cost one day know, that it shall not be sufficient to say, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and not die daily unto sin, that so they might have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto righteousness; for he never knew such workers of iniquity: but and if hearts be hardned, and grow worse and worse, it is known to what end; and we are of more value then many sparrows, who are now sold two for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:150073:66"/> so unequal is mans dealings.</p>

               <l>But know, O <hi>England,</hi> this is the word</l>
               <l>That truth to thee doth yet afford:</l>
               <l>Because thou dost not yet well know</l>

               <l>But know, before thou be aware,</l>
               <l>He may in fury burn thee up,</l>
               <l>If that thou slight salvations cup:</l>
               <l>And yet the same which was, is he,</l>

               <l>But if thou wilt not changed be,</l>
               <l>Still he stands firm in his decree,</l>

            <p>And all ye people of <hi>England, be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake</hi> onely, and see him go before you in all your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for Satan divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself cannot stand. And <hi>let every soul be subject to the higher powers; for the powers that be are of God:</hi> and rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft; and therefore rise not up to destroy your brethren, or your fellow-servants, because they are not contending it may be for the same thing or form
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:150073:67"/> that you are contending for; yet none of you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for the precious faith which was once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Saints, by which we know our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neerer then when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. I say, destroy not him for whom Christ died; by that rule he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy thee: Oh cursed <hi>Cain,</hi> thy hand against every man, and every mans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee! What and if thy brother be led by a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible spirit? so art thou; and nothing shall overcome but a spirit of meekness: a fiery zeal for you know not what, shall avail you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the day of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:150073:67"/> Lord, but love shall endure for ever. Surely you may look that the Lord cut you off in your sins, if you bite and devour one another. You talk of degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but this is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of imperfection, I am sure. Did not <hi>Englands</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters stir you up to kill and devour one another at the beginning of the wars? but that it is impossible for the blinde to see, you might have known them by their fruits, for all their sheeps clothing: and what are you still plotting and agitating mischief? your thoughts are very vain, in thinking you can do any thing for
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:150073:68"/> God by strife and hatred, envy and malice, and smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the fist of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: this must not prevail: the fruits of the Spirit of God are clean contrary, from which your sins have made a separation. If bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and thorns go together in battel, consider what will the end be. And truly the Lord will now be honoured on them that would not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him; for fighting, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and all manner of evil, doth dishonour him. And though you may promise to your selves <hi>Things</hi> &amp; <hi>Forms,</hi> and <hi>Likenesses,</hi> you shall all fail of your expectation, your weapons and your
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:150073:68"/> ends being carnal, and you still carnally minded, and therefore such unfruitfull works of darknesse are wrought. Oh your darkness is felt, and what it will bring forth; the seed of God being yet in bondage, and captivity is not yet led captive, neither can you say in truth your Redeemer lives, who seeks to save mens lives, and not destroy them.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>England,</hi> when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how thou hast groped for the wall at noon-days, and didst lean to thine own understanding, and chosest to walk in the crooked and blinde paths, and rann'st
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:150073:69"/> when the Lord never sent thee, neither living or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in him, though thou often saidst thou didst, in thy vain repetitions, saying thou wast of the vine, but thy fruit was thistles, and therefore fit for the fire: and thou saidst likewise thou wast the wheat; but the Lord came to try, and found thee chaff, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art thou scattered; and in all this the Lord is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for it is the living that praise him, which thou hast been often told: hadst thou had an ear to have heard, thou wouldst not have been contented with the name onely of protesting against
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:150073:69"/>
               <hi>Antichrist,</hi> &amp; denied the <hi>Lord</hi> that paid a price for thee, trampling the blood of the covenant under feet, count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it an unholy thing; and in the mean time how much swines bloud didst thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up? and instead of a sweet smell, what a bad sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was there! Oh how hath the sanctuary of the Lord been polluted by all this!</p>
            <p>And how hast thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned the Sabbath, and the day of the Lord, and called it <hi>Sunday,</hi> meaning as many houres as thou thoughtst to refrain from sinning! thou mightst as well set up an Hour-glass,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:150073:70"/> and say in thy vain heart, This is the hour and time of darkness. But thou hadst no bonds from sinning; thy guide was very unequal in all his way; his hour or day was to last for term of life, and so by him wast thou taught to plead for sin, for that term: the first <hi>Adam,</hi> or a stop to righteousness, thou wast well known to, and lovedst; but the second <hi>Adam</hi> thou delightedst not to be acquainted with, which would have stopped thee from observations of days, and times, and new Moons and Sabbaths, and led thee into the power of an endless life, which was
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:150073:70"/> hid from thee, because thou wast lost, and yet thoughtst thou wast rich, and hadst need of nothing; but thy thoughts were as vain as thy actions, and the <hi>one thing necessay</hi> thou didst not heed; and therefore is night come over the Seers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and they have no visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because they hated to be reformed, and would none of the counsel of the Lord: for I have heard some of them say (that they might be judged out of their own mouths, in their prayers or vain repetitions) <hi>Lord, we do not receive, because we have not true faith:</hi> a true saying as they could speak; and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:150073:71"/> that was the cause why their prayers, or any other worship, did not please God: for had they had true faith as a grain of mustard-seed, it would have brought to pass that which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for them to believe without it. And in another vain repetition I have heard some of <hi>Englands</hi> Ministers say, <hi>Lord, we do not receive, because we ask amiss;</hi> and so have made a trade of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing, and cry out they can never forsake: therefore hath their peace been hid from their eyes; for they did not turn people from darkness to light, from the power of Satan to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:150073:71"/> of God; but they were always learning of them, and yet the learners nor teachers never attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the knowledge of God, because they cryed down and put out the light within, which ought to have been set up, to give light to every house, and not put under a measure of unbelief or darkness.</p>
            <p>O foolish sons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>England,</hi> how have you been bewitched by those of the black art! what, did you think to be called Christians was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and the prince of darkness bear rule in you? Oh how hath he ruled in

Oh how like were you to the hypocrites of old which so many woes Christ pronounced against! did you not love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the markets, and to be called of men Master? and did you not devour wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows houses, because for conscience sake they could not put into your mouths? and for all this, that oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and violence were in your hands, you thought
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150073:72"/> you should be heard by your much babling, and long prayers, saying, <hi>Lord make us of one heart and one minde;</hi> but your God could not hear you, for he never yet answered you: but the living God saith you did not seek him where he was to be found; though you did draw neer to him with your lips, yet your hearts were far off him: all your cryings, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> did little avail, being you did not deny your selves and do his will. And how like were you to those of old, whom Christ saith to, <hi>Depart from me, you workers of iniquity; for when I was</hi>

For how do the dumb open, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and harmless sheep speak to you by their looks, groanes and bleatings! which you are not sensible of, your hearts being as hard as the nether mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone: for if they were not, I bear witness for you, you would be sensible of the groan of the creature, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:150073:75"/> would be moved in pity and compassion, and not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise so much cruelty on them; and not onely on them, but on your fellow-members, for whom Christ Jesus the light of the world hath laid down his life for, your own brethren in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> whom he comes to call to repentance, and whom he pities, and desires not their destruction, but rather that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and live with him and in him. If you do extend so much cruelty to the dumb creature, whom ye are like in some respects, but in the better part they exceed you; for the ox knoweth his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:150073:76"/> his cruel owner, and the ass his masters crib; but you do not know me, saith the holy One; for I dwell in an humble and contrite heart, and you are exalted above all that is called God, in the cruelty, and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and abuse of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that end. And to let you see the inequality of your way, if you do shew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny respect or esteem of any creature, it is above the Creator, still in the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in that love or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which may seem good if it be pleased: but when it is tried what it can endure, it changes. Oh friends, this
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:150073:76"/> that I speak of, never went thorow the fire once, and therefore is not like to be tryed seven times.</p>
            <p>And this is writ to thee, O <hi>England,</hi> that seeing thou mightest see, and pursue the things that belong to thy everlasting Peace,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:150073:77"/> and sure satisfaction to thy languishing immortal Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Day co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that it be quite hid from thy Eyes: For that which was <hi>Davids</hi> comfort, will short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overtake thee; and as thou repents, returns and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:150073:77"/> accordingly it shall prove a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it shall the Wages give of that which cannot do this and live.</p>
